	<p><b>Volleyball, a game played by two teams, usually six players on one side, in which the players use their hands to bat a ball back and forth over a high net, attempting to get the ball to hit the court inside the play area of the opponents so they can return it. To stop this, a player on the losing team bats the ball and a teammate until it hits the floor of the court.</b></p>

	<h1>Skills of the volleyball</h1>
	<p><b>The six basic skills in volleyball pass, set, spike, block, dig and serve. Passing is also considered to be the most important skill in volleyball.

	<p><b>Passing is also considered to be the most important skill in volleyball. If you are unable to pass the serve, then you will not ever be able to score a point for your side.

For certain cases the significance of serving is undervalued. Many coaches don't encourage players to serve vigorously and take advantage of this opportunity to give the team an advantage for points.</b></p>

<p><b>Perhaps blocking is the least taught skill in volleyball. Players will get away with poor blocking skills as not blocking would not damage the team as much as performing other skills in volleyball will be bad.

Digging is another talent that doesn't reflect on as much as other volleyball abilities.The setter position in volleyball is known as the most critical position. The setter effectively runs offense against the squad.</b></p>
