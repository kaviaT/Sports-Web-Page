		<!--Third Paragraph-->
		<p> Basically when two players are playing (One player each side), Service should go cross. Which means if you're in Right side the service of the shuttle should land at the Left side. When you're the one who doing the service, If your mark is a even number you should start service from Right side. And also if your mark is Odd number, You should start service from Left side. There a Rule Called Short Service. If a Player put the serve short (below 1.98m) It'll be a Short Service. So one Point will go to Opponent side. Point Struture is only one point. You can't get two points at once. And when you're playing singles your court is only dealing with 152cm's. Which means Side 46cm lines are Out lines. When playing with Doubles you can Deal with the whole court. When you're playing a Doubles Tournment Your all services cannot put more than 6.10m. The it'll be a Long Service.<br></p>
